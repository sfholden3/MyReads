# MyReads
Project at the end of Udacity React Fundamentals course.

This project allows a user to orangize a limited selection of books into 'Read', 'Want to Read', and 'Currently Reading' bookshelves.  They can add a book to the bookshelf by clicking on the "plus" icon on the bottom right, searching to find their desired book, and selecting which shelf they want it to appear on.

You can get this project started by cloning the repo, running npm install and npm start. 

Thanks!
